# LP-0018: Spam Protection for Atomic-Swap Makers [Draft]

**`Status`**:

- Draft: Not yet ready
- Open: Ready for application
- Completed: Submission accepted, prize completed

**`Logos Circle: N/A`**

## Overview

Atomic-swap markets have a maker/taker architecture. A **maker** is a persistent
identity that publishes quotes and holds inventory ready to swap; a **taker** is
a one-shot user who initiates a swap against a maker's quote. The maker invests
in identity (discovery, reputation, often capital) over many swaps; the taker
may be anonymous and one-shot. This asymmetry is the design.

But it leaves the maker exposed to **spam by malicious takers**. In every
direction of an atomic-swap protocol, one side locks first and the other side
locks second. Whoever locks first incurs the on-chain refund-transaction fee if
the swap aborts, and the second party gets to observe the first lock and decide
whether to advance (the free-option problem; see
[atomic-swaps primer §The free-option problem](../appendix/atomic-swaps-primer.md#the-free-option-problem)).
When the maker is the locks-first side, an adversarial taker can spam by
initiating and abandoning swaps repeatedly, costing the maker only the refund
transaction fee per cycle — exactly the "draining attack" Hoenisch and del Pino
2021 §4 analyses.

This prize is for a **mechanism that protects atomic-swap makers from taker
spam** in the LEZ atomic-swap protocol (RFP-003), without specifying the
mechanism. Solvers are free to design bonds, fee-burns, deposits, reputation,
slashing schemes, or any combination, as long as the chosen mechanism delivers
proven spam reduction while preserving honest-taker and honest-maker
reliability. Reference prior art exists
([eigenwallet PR #675](https://github.com/eigenwallet/core/pull/675)); the prize
does not prescribe that approach.

### Scope: XMR↔LEZ, both directions

For BTC-XMR, the protocol design makes the *taker* the locks-first side (BTC
seller is the customer), which limits spam exposure to the standard
draining-attack cost. **For XMR↔LEZ this is not freely chooseable.** Monero
today provides no on-chain primitive that supports the locks-first role in any
published atomic-swap construction, so **the LEZ side must always lock first**,
regardless of trade direction. See
[atomic-swaps primer §Locking order](../appendix/atomic-swaps-primer.md#locking-order);
the constraint is protocol-level, not economic. This creates two distinct
sub-cases for XMR↔LEZ:

- **Sub-case A: LEZ-side party is the *taker*** (trade direction LEZ→XMR; user
  holds Logos, wants XMR). The taker locks LEZ first. The maker holds the
  post-lock free option — he sees the taker's LEZ lock and decides whether to
  lock XMR off-chain. The mechanism must price or close the maker's free option
  without harming the taker's experience. Candidate examples include a fee-burn
  or non-refundable deposit on the LEZ refund branch (cf. eigenwallet PR #675
  for BTC). Not prescribed.
- **Sub-case B: LEZ-side party is the *maker*** (trade direction XMR→LEZ; user
  holds XMR, wants Logos). The maker locks LEZ first. The taker can spam the
  maker by repeatedly initiating-and-abandoning swaps — exactly the
  draining-attack condition the BTC-first ordering is meant to eliminate for
  BTC-XMR, but which we cannot eliminate for XMR-LEZ in this direction because
  LEZ must lock first regardless. The mechanism must protect the maker from this
  spam. Candidate approaches include reputation, taker-side bonds, taker
  fee-burns, or other.

**Scope of this prize: XMR↔LEZ only.** Follow-up prizes can cover LEZ↔BTC,
LEZ↔ETH, or other pairs once the XMR↔LEZ case has a winning mechanism.

**Single prize, two acceptable solution shapes.** Applicants may address
sub-case A only, sub-case B only, or both. A submission that addresses both
sub-cases coherently ranks above one that addresses only one, but a credible
single-sub-case mechanism is sufficient to win.

## Motivation

The atomic-swap branch of the cross-chain DEX design tree has a known structural
weakness on the free-option / spam-the-maker problem. The Logos cross-chain DEX
bundle (RFPs 021, 024, 025, 026) uses the vanilla RFP-003 atomic swap as the
privacy-non-custodial primitive, but vanilla atomic swaps remain economically
unattractive for makers at scale because of the spam exposure. Without a
credible spam-protection mechanism, the maker side of the LEZ atomic-swap market
is likely to remain at hobbyist scale (see
[eigenwallet](https://github.com/eigenwallet/core/): community-scale,
single-digit active makers, BTC→XMR direction only).

A competitive prize is the right mechanism because the design space is large and
the right answer is not obvious. On-LEZ bonds, external-chain fee-burns,
reputation gating, hybrid designs, or approaches we have not anticipated may all
qualify. The Logos team does not want to pre-judge.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Proven spam reduction.** The submission must include hard stats (e.g.
  measured per-maker spam-attempt rate before and after the mechanism over a
  stated observation window) and/or testimony from at least two independent
  active makers running the mechanism in production. Toy numbers from a testnet
  alone are not sufficient — the prize requires the solution be polished, used,
  and adopted.
- [ ] **No reduction in reliability for honest takers.** An honest taker
  initiating a legitimate swap should not experience materially worse liveness,
  settlement time, or failure rate than under the vanilla RFP-003 protocol.
  Quantify against a baseline.
- [ ] **No reduction in reliability for honest makers.** An honest maker serving
  legitimate takers should not experience materially worse liveness or capital
  efficiency than under the vanilla RFP-003 protocol. Quantify against a
  baseline.

## Design constraints

These are framing, not pass/fail criteria. Submissions that violate them are
unlikely to deliver the success criteria above, but the criteria above are what
evaluators measure.

- **Compatible with the RFP-003 LEZ atomic-swap SDK as the underlying
  primitive.** The mechanism should not require changes to the cryptographic
  core (joint-key setup, adaptor signature, lock, reveal). Solvers may add
  escrow logic around the swap.
- **Preserves non-custody.** No third party (signer set, validator, oracle,
  attestor) should hold user funds at any stage. Reintroducing federated trust
  defeats the purpose; RFP-021 already covers that design space.
- **Survives the LEZ-locks-first protocol constraint.** For XMR↔LEZ the LEZ side
  locks first in both sub-cases (A and B). The mechanism must work under this
  constraint, not assume it can be reversed.
- **Burnt or escrowed principal in adverse paths is not payable to the
  counterparty in a way that creates new griefing incentives.** If a defaulting
  taker's deposit is paid to the maker, the maker has an incentive to provoke
  refunds; this defeats the purpose. Burn destinations (unspendable outputs) or
  rebated-to-protocol designs are acceptable; counterparty-paid designs are not.
- **Honest-refund / connectivity-loss paths.** An honest party who refunds due
  to connectivity issues should not lose disproportionately. The mechanism's
  cost in adverse paths should be bounded.
- **Discoverable parameters.** The cost the taker faces under the mechanism
  (deposit fraction, bond size, fee fraction, etc.) should be known to the taker
  before they initiate the swap. Quote-level discovery is acceptable.

## Scope

### In Scope

- The spam-protection mechanism itself: design, on-chain components (LEZ
  program, external-chain script changes if any), client-side SDK, integration
  with RFP-003's per-pair atomic-swap modules.
- One or both XMR↔LEZ sub-cases (A and/or B), with an incentive-compatibility
  argument that explains why the mechanism makes the abort branch EV-negative
  for the attacker.
- A reference deployment with active makers and takers running the mechanism in
  production long enough to gather the proven-reduction stats / testimony.

### Out of Scope

- Modifying the underlying RFP-003 atomic-swap cryptography (joint-key setup,
  adaptor signature, lock/reveal).
- Reintroducing federated trust (TSS custody, signer sets, oracle attestors).
  RFP-021 covers that design space.
- LEZ↔BTC, LEZ↔ETH, or other non-XMR pairs. Follow-up prizes if needed.

- **Effort:** L

> Leave prize pool blank — this will be determined by the Logos team. Single
> winner by default.

## Eligibility

Open to any individual or team. Submissions must be original work. Teams must
hold the rights to all submitted code and agree to license it under MIT or
Apache-2.0.

## Submission Requirements

A submission must include:

- A public repository containing the LEZ program(s), client SDK, integration
  tests, and any external-chain script changes.
- A written design document covering the mechanism, the adversarial model, the
  incentive-compatibility argument, and the honest-refund / connectivity-loss
  handling.
- Proven-reduction evidence: hard stats from a real deployment, and/or signed
  testimony from at least two independent active makers running the mechanism.
- A narrated video walkthrough demo showing (a) honest completion at no extra
  cost to honest parties, and (b) at least one adversarial-taker scenario where
  the mechanism deters the attack.
- A short comparison against reference prior art (minimum: eigenwallet PR #675),
  stating what the submission borrows, where it diverges, and why.

## Evaluation Process

By default, submissions are evaluated first-come-first-served against the
success criteria. The first submission that meets all criteria wins.

Evaluators will independently clone the repository, run the demo script,
exercise at least one adversarial-taker scenario, and verify the
proven-reduction evidence (cross-checking testimony with the named makers).

Because the design space is large and multiple valid approaches exist,
evaluators may rank tied submissions on:

1. Coverage across sub-cases (a mechanism addressing both A and B ranks above
   one addressing only one).
2. Magnitude of demonstrated spam reduction and quality of the adoption
   evidence.
3. Capital efficiency: mechanisms that impose less cost on honest users rank
   above mechanisms that always impose cost.
4. Integration cleanliness with RFP-003's existing per-pair modules.

The following policies apply to all prizes (see
[evaluation policies](https://github.com/logos-co/lambda-prize/blob/main/README.md#evaluation-policies)):

- **Submissions:** each builder (or team) is allowed a maximum of **3
  submissions** per prize, with at most **one submission/review per week**.
- **Feedback:** initial evaluation feedback is limited to a pass/fail indication
  against the success criteria.

## Potential for Subsequent λPrizes

If this prize is awarded for an XMR↔LEZ mechanism, follow-up prizes may cover
other pairs (LEZ↔BTC, LEZ↔ETH) where the locks-first constraint is less
restrictive and the spam-protection design space differs.
