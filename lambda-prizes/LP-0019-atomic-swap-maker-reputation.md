# LP-0019: Taker Reliability for Atomic Swaps [Draft]

**`Status`**:

- Draft: Not yet ready
- Open: Ready for application
- Completed: Submission accepted, prize completed

**`Logos Circle: N/A`**

## Overview

Atomic-swap markets have a maker/taker architecture (see
[LP-0018 §Overview](./LP-0018-atomic-swap-anti-spam.md#overview)). The **maker**
is a persistent identity holding inventory; the **taker** is a one-shot user
initiating a swap against a maker's quote. This prize addresses the **taker's
exposure to maker misbehaviour**.

Concrete maker misbehaviours that hurt takers include:

- **Quote-and-walk.** Maker publishes a quote, taker initiates a swap, maker
  refuses to lock the destination asset after the taker locks. Taker's funds are
  wedged for the full refund window before recovery.
- **Refusal to advance after taker lock.** Maker received the taker's lock event
  but chooses not to claim or advance. The protocol unwinds, but the taker pays
  time and fees.
- **Selectively serving (maker discriminates).** Maker honours some takers and
  griefs others, with no protocol-level recourse.
- **Disappearance mid-swap.** Maker goes offline after partial progress; the
  swap times out via refund paths but the taker bears the latency cost.

In the LEZ atomic-swap protocol (RFP-003), the on-chain settlement contract can
detect *some* maker misbehaviour from LEZ state alone (failure to lock the LEZ
leg before timeout, failure to publish the reveal). For events that LEZ cannot
see — particularly any event on the Monero side — the protocol cannot adjudicate
without help.

This prize is for a **mechanism that delivers measurable taker-reliability
improvement against maker misbehaviour** in the LEZ atomic-swap protocol,
without specifying the mechanism. The design space is open: solvers may use
on-chain attestation, off-chain proof bundles, slashable bonds, watchtower
designs, reputation systems, or any combination, as long as the resulting
mechanism delivers proven taker-reliability improvement while preserving
honest-maker and honest-taker reliability.

This prize is the **dual of LP-0018**:

- LP-0018 protects the maker against malicious or spamming *takers*.
- LP-0019 (this prize) protects the taker against malicious or unreliable
  *makers*.

Both can be deployed together.

### Scope: XMR↔LEZ, both directions

For XMR↔LEZ, the LEZ side must lock first by protocol (Monero today provides no
on-chain primitive that supports the locks-first role in any published
atomic-swap construction; see
[atomic-swaps primer §Locking order](../appendix/atomic-swaps-primer.md#locking-order)).
This creates two sub-cases the prize covers:

- **Sub-case A: LEZ-side party is the *taker*** (LEZ→XMR; taker holds Logos,
  wants XMR). The taker locks LEZ first, then waits for the maker to lock XMR
  off-chain. The maker can quote-and-walk by never locking XMR. From LEZ alone
  the protocol cannot tell whether the maker walked or the taker's claim of a
  quote-and-walk is fabricated. **Mechanisms that improve taker reliability in
  this sub-case must produce maker-misbehaviour evidence that other parties can
  verify** (so the taker is not left with a he-said-she-said dispute).
- **Sub-case B: LEZ-side party is the *maker*** (XMR→LEZ; taker holds XMR, wants
  Logos). The maker locks LEZ first, then waits for the taker to advance with
  the reveal. From LEZ the protocol can detect the maker's lock directly;
  taker-reliability concerns here focus on **maker selective serving** (refusing
  to quote, refusing to honour a quote, quoting deceptively) and on **liveness**
  (maker disappearing mid-swap after their LEZ lock has confirmed).

**Scope of this prize: XMR↔LEZ only.** Follow-up prizes may cover other pairs.

**Single prize, two acceptable solution shapes.** Applicants may address
sub-case A only, sub-case B only, or both. A submission addressing both ranks
above one addressing only one, but a credible single-sub-case mechanism is
sufficient to win.

## Motivation

In an atomic-swap protocol with no reputation or attribution layer, every taker
swap is a first-time interaction. A maker who misbehaves once can disappear and
reappear under a new identity at zero cost; a maker who misbehaves
systematically against some takers but not others has no protocol-level
deterrent. Vanilla RFP-003 atomic swaps cannot offer the taker the kind of "I
know this counterparty has reliably served thousands of swaps" guarantee that
middle-chain DEXes get for free (their counterparty is the protocol).

A competitive prize is the right mechanism because the design space is large and
the right answer is not obvious. Reputation systems (on-chain or off-chain),
slashable bonds, watchtower designs, hybrid approaches, or solutions we have not
anticipated may all qualify. The Logos team does not want to pre-judge.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Proven taker-reliability improvement.** The submission must include hard
  stats (e.g. measured taker-side swap-success rate before and after the
  mechanism, or measured incidence of maker misbehaviour detected/deterred by
  the mechanism over a stated observation window) and/or testimony from at least
  two independent active takers running against makers integrated with the
  mechanism in production. Toy numbers from a testnet alone are not sufficient —
  the prize requires the solution be polished, used, and adopted.
- [ ] **No reduction in reliability for honest makers.** An honest maker serving
  legitimate takers should not experience materially worse liveness, capital
  efficiency, or quote-distribution reach than under the vanilla RFP-003
  protocol. Quantify against a baseline.
- [ ] **No reduction in reliability for honest takers.** The mechanism's own
  cost to honest takers (latency, gas, complexity) must not exceed the
  unreliability it removes. Quantify against a baseline.

## Design constraints

These are framing, not pass/fail criteria.

- **Compatible with the RFP-003 LEZ atomic-swap SDK as the underlying
  primitive.** Do not require changes to the cryptographic core.
- **Preserves non-custody.** No third party (signer set, validator, oracle,
  attestor) holds user funds at any stage. Reintroducing federated trust defeats
  the purpose; RFP-021 already covers that design space.
- **Adversarially robust.** The mechanism must distinguish a *fabricated* taker
  complaint about an honest maker from a *valid* taker complaint about a
  malicious maker. Either the protocol detects the difference from observable
  state, or the mechanism produces evidence a third party can verify, or the
  mechanism penalises false complaints. Any approach is acceptable; the
  submission must justify it.
- **Privacy of the taker.** A taker reporting a misbehaving maker should not be
  forced to reveal which other swaps the taker has done (beyond the disputed
  one), unless the taker chooses to.
- **Spam resistance.** A malicious taker should not be able to mass-publish
  fabricated misbehaviour reports to deny-of-service the mechanism. Either the
  cost of publishing is bounded below or the verifier filters cheaply.
- **Survives the LEZ↔XMR Monero-unobservability constraint.** For sub-case A
  specifically, the Monero side is not directly observable from LEZ. The
  mechanism must work under this constraint; it may use any approach (view-key
  disclosure, FCMP++-grade zk proofs, watchtower nodes, multi-party attestation,
  on-chain attestation by the maker, slashable maker bonds, off-chain proof
  bundles, etc.).

## Scope

### In Scope

- The taker-reliability mechanism: data model, evidence/attribution scheme,
  verification approach, aggregation if relevant, anti-spam and anti-fabrication
  mechanisms.
- Storage and distribution of any data the mechanism produces (Logos Delivery is
  the expected substrate for off-chain data; on-chain mechanisms use LEZ).
- Client-side: SDK for takers to query maker reliability and report
  misbehaviour; SDK for makers to dispute false reports if applicable.
- A reference integration with RFP-003 LEZ atomic-swap maker daemon and taker
  client.
- A reference deployment with active takers and makers running the mechanism in
  production long enough to gather the proven-reliability stats / testimony.

### Out of Scope

- Modifying the underlying RFP-003 atomic-swap cryptography.
- Building a protocol-level slashing mechanism on top of the reliability
  evidence (LP-0018 covers the maker-side equivalent; if the mechanisms produce
  evidence usable for slashing, integration with LP-0018 is welcomed but not
  required).
- LEZ↔BTC, LEZ↔ETH, or other non-XMR pairs.

> winner by default.

## Eligibility

Open to any individual or team. Submissions must be original work. Teams must
hold the rights to all submitted code and agree to license it under MIT or
Apache-2.0.

## Submission Requirements

A submission must include:

- A public repository containing the LEZ program(s) if any, client SDK,
  integration tests, and any external-chain components.
- A written design document covering the mechanism, the adversarial model
  (sybil, spam, fabrication, false-rebuttal), the privacy analysis (what the
  mechanism reveals about whom), and the LEZ↔XMR-specific handling of Monero
  unobservability.
- Proven-reliability evidence: hard stats from a real deployment, and/or signed
  testimony from at least two independent active takers running against makers
  integrated with the mechanism.
- A narrated video walkthrough demo showing (a) honest swap completion with no
  extra cost, (b) a maker-misbehaviour scenario where the mechanism detects and
  surfaces the misbehaviour, and (c) a fabricated-complaint scenario where the
  mechanism rejects or penalises the fabrication.

## Evaluation Process

By default, submissions are evaluated first-come-first-served against the
success criteria. The first submission that meets all criteria wins.

Evaluators will independently clone the repository, run the demo, exercise the
maker-misbehaviour and fabricated-complaint scenarios, and verify the
proven-reliability evidence.

Tied submissions may be ranked on:

1. Coverage across sub-cases (a mechanism addressing both A and B ranks above
   one addressing only one).
2. Magnitude of demonstrated reliability improvement and quality of the adoption
   evidence.
3. Privacy cost (lower disclosure to third parties is preferred where the
   mechanism uses disclosure).
4. Adversarial robustness across more distinct attack vectors (sybil, spam,
   fabrication, false-rebuttal).
5. Integration cleanliness with RFP-003's existing maker daemon and taker
   client.

The following policies apply to all prizes (see
[evaluation policies](https://github.com/logos-co/lambda-prize/blob/main/README.md#evaluation-policies)):

- **Submissions:** each builder (or team) is allowed a maximum of **3
  submissions** per prize, with at most **one submission/review per week**.
- **Feedback:** initial evaluation feedback is limited to a pass/fail indication
  against the success criteria.
